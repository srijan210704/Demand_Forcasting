🚀 Project: Sales Prediction using Machine Learning

Goal: The objective was to build a machine learning model that predicts the number of units sold for different products in various stores. This is useful for inventory planning, demand forecasting, and marketing optimization.

🔹 Approach & Steps

Data Exploration

Loaded the dataset into Pandas and explored columns, datatypes, and distributions.

Identified important features such as week, store_id, sku_id, and units_sold.

Feature Engineering

Transformed the week column into day, month, and year to capture seasonality.

Applied one-hot encoding to categorical columns (store_id, sku_id) to make them machine-readable.

Outlier Handling

Found that units_sold had extreme outliers (above the 99th percentile).

Removed them to improve robustness of the model.

Model Training

Started with RandomForestRegressor because of its robustness and ability to capture non-linear relationships.

Initial results gave an RMSE of ~27.

After outlier removal and one-hot encoding, RMSE improved to ~17.8, showing a big boost in accuracy.

Hyperparameter Tuning

Used GridSearchCV with cross-validation to tune hyperparameters (n_estimators, min_samples_split).

This ensured the model is not just accurate but also well-generalized.

🔹 Key Learnings

Data preprocessing is crucial — encoding and handling outliers improved performance significantly.

Model evaluation with proper metrics — RMSE was a better indicator of error than accuracy for regression.

Hyperparameter tuning matters — GridSearchCV automated the search for the best settings.

🔹 Future Scope

Try advanced models like Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or LightGBM.

Perform time-series forecasting since data has a temporal element.

Use feature importance analysis to identify which stores/products drive sales most.

⚡ Interview Tip: Don’t just list steps — explain why you did them (e.g., “I used one-hot encoding because models don’t understand categorical text directly”). That shows depth.

Would you like me to also create a 2-minute spoken self-introduction version of this project (like a script you can say in the interview)?

📊 Sales Prediction using Machine Learning
📝 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the number of units sold for various products across different stores.
Accurate sales prediction is critical for inventory management, demand forecasting, and marketing optimization.

This project demonstrates the complete ML workflow — from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

📂 Dataset

Input Dataset: train_0irEZ2H.csv

Key Columns:

week → Original date feature (dd/mm/yy format).

store_id → Identifier for the store.

sku_id → Identifier for the product.

units_sold → Target variable (number of units sold).

⚙️ Steps & Methodology
🔹 1. Data Exploration

Loaded dataset using pandas.

Checked structure, missing values, and distributions.

🔹 2. Feature Engineering

Extracted day, month, and year from the week column.

Applied One-Hot Encoding on store_id and sku_id to handle categorical data.

🔹 3. Outlier Handling

Identified extreme values in units_sold (>99th percentile).

Removed these outliers to improve model stability.

🔹 4. Model Training

Initial model: RandomForestRegressor.

Split dataset into train/test sets.

Evaluation metrics:

R² Score

Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

🔹 5. Results

Initial RMSE: ~27

After preprocessing & encoding: RMSE improved to ~17.8

🔹 6. Hyperparameter Tuning

Used GridSearchCV with 5-fold Cross-Validation.

Tuned hyperparameters:

n_estimators (number of trees).

min_samples_split (minimum samples to split a node).

📈 Key Learnings

Data preprocessing (outlier handling, encoding) can drastically improve performance.

RandomForest works well for tabular sales prediction tasks.

Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV ensures a more generalized model.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Try Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, or LightGBM.

Explore time-series forecasting models (ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM).

Perform feature importance analysis to identify key drivers of sales.

Deploy the model using Flask/Django + Streamlit/React for real-time predictions.
